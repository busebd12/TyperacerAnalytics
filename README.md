# TyperacerAnalytics
A multi-threaded program that utilizes C++11, C++14, Boost, and the fast-cpp-csv-parser to analyze the four years worth of typing races I've completed at play.typeracer.com

I would like to thank <a href="https://github.com/ben-strasser">@ben-strasser</a> for creating the fast-cpp-csv-parser, it has saved me quite a bit of headache for this project. I have included the license for the repository in my repository as well and the repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/ben-strasser/fast-cpp-csv-parser">here</a>.
